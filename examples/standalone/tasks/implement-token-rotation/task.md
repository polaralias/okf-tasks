# Implement token rotation

## Outcome

Authenticated sessions receive a newly rotated token without interrupting valid requests.

## Scope

- In scope: rotate tokens after successful authentication.
- Out of scope: periodic background rotation.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Replace the pre-authentication token after login.
- [ ] Preserve the active request through rotation.
- [ ] Cover success and failure behavior with integration tests.

## Dependencies and risks

- Confirm current session storage behavior before implementation.

## Related knowledge

- No canonical repository source has been identified; promotion remains required before completion.

## Workstreams

- No separate workstreams.

## Evidence

- No implementation evidence yet.
- Effort: [initial implementation session](./task.md#time:20260717t090000z-agent-tracked) recorded 75 active minutes within a 90-minute window.
