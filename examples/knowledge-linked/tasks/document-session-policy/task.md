  confidence: high
  basis: One focused review and documentation pass against verified behavior.

# Document the session rotation policy

## Outcome

The repository has an evidence-backed policy describing when and how sessions rotate.

## Scope

- In scope: authentication-time rotation and failure handling.
- Out of scope: refresh-token expiry policy.

## Acceptance

- [x] Verify current behavior in tests.
- [x] Update the canonical architecture document.

## Dependencies and risks

- None.

## Related knowledge

- [Session architecture](../../docs/architecture/sessions.md)

## Workstreams

- No separate workstreams.

## Evidence

- Validation: session integration suite passed.
- Promotion: [Session architecture](../../docs/architecture/sessions.md) now records the verified policy.
- Effort: 45 manually recorded minutes covering policy review and documentation.
- Entry: [policy review session](./task.md#time:20260717t100000z-james-manual).
