# Identity Events

## Contract

The interface uses explicit versions, stable identifiers, bounded payloads, and machine-readable error semantics.

## Compatibility

- Additive fields remain optional through the supported migration window.
- Breaking changes require a new version and a linked migration decision.
- Consumers must tolerate duplicate delivery and preserve idempotency.

## Producers, consumers, and decisions

- [Tenant Service](../services/tenant-service.md)
- [Migration Service](../services/migration-service.md)
