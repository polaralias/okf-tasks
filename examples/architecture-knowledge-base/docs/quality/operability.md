# Operability quality attribute

## Scenario

When the platform is under realistic load or partial failure, operability remains measurable through an explicit stimulus, environment, response, and response measure.

## Measures

| Measure | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Detection | Within five minutes |
| Recovery evidence | Linked to the affected service and decision |
| Review cadence | At every material architecture change |

## Design basis

- [Resilience Model](../architecture/resilience-model.md)
- [ADR 019: Bounded Retry Policies](../decisions/adr-019-bounded-retry-policies.md)
