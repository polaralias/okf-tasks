# Tenant Service

## Responsibilities

- Own the service's domain invariants and persistence boundary.
- Publish versioned events after durable state changes.
- Expose health, readiness, trace, and domain metrics.

## API and data ownership

| Surface | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Commands | Authenticated, idempotent, and tenant-scoped. |
| Queries | Pagination and stable consistency semantics. |
| Events | Versioned envelope with correlation and causation IDs. |

## Dependencies

- [Request Lifecycle](../architecture/request-lifecycle.md)
- [Identity Events](../interfaces/identity-events.md)
