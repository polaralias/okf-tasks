# ADR 007: Schema Registry Compatibility

## Context

The platform needs an explicit and reviewable choice for schema registry compatibility. The decision affects service ownership, failure recovery, and the shape of evidence retained by delivery tasks.

## Decision

Adopt the named approach as the default architecture policy. Exceptions require a linked decision record that describes the narrower context and migration implications.

## Consequences

- Teams gain a consistent default and a visible dependency surface.
- Implementation work must preserve the documented compatibility boundary.
- Operational evidence becomes part of acceptance rather than a later activity.

<details>
<summary>Alternatives considered</summary>

Central coordination, implicit conventions, and provider-specific coupling were rejected because they weaken portability or make drift harder to review.
