# Prototype the event backbone

## Outcome

Deliver the observable result described by **prototype the event backbone** and leave reviewable evidence for the next task.

## Scope

- In scope: implementation, validation, and handoff for this delivery slice.
- Out of scope: unrelated product changes and production credentials.

## Acceptance

- [ ] The result is demonstrable in the dummy programme environment.
- [ ] Relevant tests and operational evidence are linked.
- [ ] Follow-on tasks can consume the outcome without rediscovery.

## Dependencies and risks

- [Validate Architecture Decision Coverage](../validate-architecture-decision-coverage/task.md)

## Related knowledge

- [Programme guidance](../../docs/architecture/request-lifecycle.md)

## Evidence

- Dummy evidence will be attached as the task advances through validation.

## Decision evidence

- [ADR 004: Tenant Key Partitioning](../../docs/decisions/adr-004-tenant-key-partitioning.md)
