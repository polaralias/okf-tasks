# Tracker-synchronised bundle

This example keeps the repository task canonical and records a Linear issue as an external projection. Provider API behaviour is not implied, but any adapter must prepare the exact outbound artefact according to sections 9.1 and 9.2 of the profile.

From the repository root, a safe body can be staged with:

```text
okf-tasks prepare-export --root . --source examples/tracker-synchronised/tasks/add-audit-events/task.md --output .okf-exports/add-audit-events.md
```

The ignored `.okf-exports/` staging directory is deliberately outside this example and should not be committed.
