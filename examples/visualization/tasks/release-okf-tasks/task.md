# Release OKF Tasks

## Outcome

The profile, reference implementation, examples, and conformance suite are ready for public use.

## Scope

- In scope: specification, viewer, validation, and release evidence.
- Out of scope: provider-specific tracker adapters.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Validate the profile and both independent implementations.
- [ ] Publish human- and agent-readable examples.
- [ ] Provide derived visualization without changing task truth.

## Dependencies and risks

- Interactive rendering loads pinned browser libraries from a CDN.

## Related knowledge

- [OKF Tasks specification](../../../SPEC.md)

## Workstreams

- [Specification and conformance](./workstreams/specification.md)
- [Visualization consumer](./workstreams/visualization.md)

## Evidence

- [Focused implementation session](./time/visualization-session.md)
